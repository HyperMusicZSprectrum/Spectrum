\subsection{Note}
	A note $ \phi $	is a vector of standard and modulated tones which will be played at the same time. These tones can be read individually or as unit what will transform them into a complex note. Beside of that the note defines the starting amplitudes of each tone.
	\begin{equation}\label{NoteRef}
		\phi=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			T_1\\
			T_2\\
			\vdots\\
			T_n
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}
	
\subsection{Complex note}
	A complex tone $ \widehat{\phi} $ is the sum of tones from one note.
	\begin{equation}\label{CompNoteRef}
	\widehat{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i, \quad T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n\in\phi
	\end{equation}
	
\subsection{Sound}
	A Sound $ \Phi $ is matrix of Notes which defines their concatenation. 
	\begin{equation}\label{SoundRef}
		\Phi_{m,n}= 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\phi_{11}&&\phi_{1n}\\
			&\ddots&\\
			\phi_{m1}&&\phi_{mn}

		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}
	It can also be defined as vector of complex notes. In this case it will be called $ \widehat{\Phi} $.
	\begin{equation}\label{CompSoundRef}
		\widehat{\Phi}_n=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\widehat{\phi}_1&\dots&\widehat{\phi}_n
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}
