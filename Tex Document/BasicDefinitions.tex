\section{Basic Definitions}
	\subsection{Sampling Rate}
	The Sampling rate $ SR $ defines the number of data units played every second. It will have the default value -- like a wave file sampling rate -- of $ 44100 $ data units per second.

	\subsection{Concert pitch}
	The concert pitch is a reference frequency to tune a group of instruments. From now on it will be called base frequency $ f_0 $ with the default value of
	\begin{equation*}
		f_0=440Hz
	\end{equation*}
